# Newton Interpolation

## Overview
Newton’s interpolation method is based on the divided difference concept and constructs polynomials incrementally.

## When to Use?
- When you have data points that are **not equally spaced**.
- When you want to easily add more points without recalculating everything.

## Advantages
✔ Efficient for incremental calculations.  
✔ Works well with unevenly spaced data points.  

## Formula
The Newton polynomial is:
P(x) = f(x₀) + f[x₀, x₁](x - x₀) + f[x₀, x₁, x₂](x - x₀)(x - x₁) + ...
