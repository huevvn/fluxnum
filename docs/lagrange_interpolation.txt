# Lagrange Interpolation

## Overview
Lagrange interpolation constructs a polynomial that passes through a given set of data points.

## When to Use?
- When you have **a small number of data points**.
- When you need an explicit formula directly without step-by-step calculations.

## Advantages
✔ Provides a single polynomial expression.  
✔ Easy to understand and implement.  

## Formula
P(x) = Σ ( f(xᵢ) * Lᵢ(x) ), where Lᵢ(x) are Lagrange basis polynomials.
