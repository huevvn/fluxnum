# ðŸ“Œ Newton Interpolation

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

Newtonâ€™s interpolation method constructs polynomials incrementally using **divided differences**. It is particularly useful when new data points are added dynamically.

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Use?

-   **Unevenly spaced data points** (handles irregular data well).
-   When you need to **incrementally add more points** without recalculating everything from scratch.

## âš¡ Advantages

âœ” Efficient for large datasets with new points.  
âœ” Works well with **unevenly spaced** data points.

## ðŸ“– Formula

Newtonâ€™s interpolation polynomial:

```math
P(x) = f(x_0) + f[x_0, x_1] (x - x_0) + f[x_0, x_1, x_2] (x - x_0)(x - x_1) + ...
```
